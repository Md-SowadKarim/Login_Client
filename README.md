# Client Side

* If you want to use it locally then you need to clone or download the file first then
* Then you will type npm init
* Then npm i
* After that you need to use http://localhost:5173/ instead of http://127.0.0.1:5173/ because I have used Firebase authentication system  of Google and firebase does not work with that
* And then you are good to go with the project
